Back in the day when I was a teacher at the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at University of Turku, I wrote quite a lot of material for my courses. While retiring an old laptop, I stumbled on the materials and decided to upload them on my webpage if someone would be curious about them. The materials I found are from the three first statistics courses which were lectured in Finnish!
