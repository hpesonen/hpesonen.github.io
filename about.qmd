I've studied some math and statistics and I'm currently a researcher at Oslo Centre for Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Oslo University Hospital. My research topic is all things related to likelihood-free inference. I'm also the coordinator of [ELFI : Engine for Likelihood-free Inference](http://elfi.ai) development team.

ELFI resides in [Github](http://github.com/elfi-dev) and the manual can be found [here](http://elfi.readthedocs.io).
